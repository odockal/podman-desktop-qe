# Kubernetes Resources Editing Feature Test Scenario

This scenario verifies the Kubernetes resources editing feature's functionality.

## Prerequisites
- A Kubernetes or OpenShift cluster, which can be a local setup (e.g., Kind, Minikube, OpenShift Local).
- Ensure you are working within the correct Kubernetes context in Podman Desktop (bottom-right corner).

## Test Scenario

1. **Navigate to Kubernetes Page**: Access the Kubernetes section via the right navigation panel.
2. **Verify Cluster Connection**: Confirm a connection to the running cluster.
3. **Access Deployments**: Go to the Kubernetes deployments page.
4. **Apply a Deployment YAML**: Use a YAML file containing a Kubernetes deployment resource [here](kubernetes/resources/test-deployment-resource.yaml).
5. **Check Deployment State**: Verify that the deployment is running with three associated pods (`deployment-name` + autogenerated suffix).
6. **Open Deployment Details**: Go to the details view of the deployment, then select the "Kube" tab.
7. **Edit the YAML**: Locate the `replicas` field, change it from `3` to `5`, and apply the changes.
   - **Note**: Not all fields are editable in Kubernetes resources (e.g., metadata like `name` or `namespace` cannot be changed). Editing the `replicas` field is a good test case for verifying that changes are reflected in real-time.
8. **Confirm Changes**: Ensure that:
   - The YAML file now shows `replicas: 5`.
   - There are 5 pods on the Pods page for the deployment.
